This is a project on Optical Flow computation according to the Hornâ€“Schunck method with additional result-improving techniques such as:
  * Gaussian Pyramids
  * Median Filter
  * Penalty Functions
  * Texture Decomposition
  * Cubic Interpolation

## Main goal ##
The main goal of this project is to implement modern real-time optical flow algorithm in C++ using [OpenCV](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/) libraries.
